# TestMyMarket

>This is a project that I made in order to practice my Selenium Webdriver skills.

>It tests the website of a supermarket with testcases that aim to:
+ select options from dropdowns
+ fill in forms
+ upload files
+ test authentication
+ make use of actions (like moveToElement)

>and also record any failure

>The project follows the **Page Object Model Design Pattern**.
